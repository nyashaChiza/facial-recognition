# Face Recognition and Image Comparison

This project implements face recognition and image comparison features using the `face_recognition` library for facial analysis and the `imagehash` library for image comparison.

## Features
- **Face Recognition:** Utilizing the `face_recognition` library to recognize faces in live camera feed.
- **Image Comparison:** Utilizing the `imagehash` library to compare faces with preloaded images for verification.

## Instructions
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/face-recognition.git`
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the application: `python main.py`

## Usage
1. Open the terminal and navigate to the project directory.
2. Run the application using: `python main.py`
3. The application will use the live camera feed to perform face recognition and image comparison.

## Important Note
- This is a basic example; real-world applications may require additional security measures, compliance with privacy laws, and more advanced image processing techniques.
